// There are three basic data types in javascript

// string (don't forget the double quote marks)
"Hello there"
"Go!"
"Jeanne"
"An entire sentence or two. I like strings! Woo hoo!"
// number
4
590
321
100000000000000000000000000000

// boolean
true
false

/* This is how we declare variables; we always start with the declaration on the left and the value on the right. 
This is called left-hand assignment */

let myAge = 38
let myGrade = 1000000000
let wearsGlasses = true

// we can declare variables that are undefined and save values into them later
let total;
// undefined


// If we want a variable to be nothing, we set it to null
let myNothingVariable = null;

// All values in javascript are either "truthy" or "falsy"

// falsy value: undefined, false, null, 0
// truthy values: true, everything else

console.log("Hello " + myName + ". " + greeting)

// We can use javascript to do math. Here, we are birdwatching. How many birds did we see?

let ducks = 7;
let geese = 2;
let robins = 14;

// addition
let totalBirds = 7 + 2 + 14;

// These are mathematical operators in javascript

// subtract

// multiply
let multiplicationAnswer = 55 * 90;
// divide
let divisionAnswer = 100 / 10;
// get the remainder
let modulusAnswer = 9 % 2;

// the modulus operater refers to remainders after doing division


// Control flows

// Conditionals (if/else statements)
